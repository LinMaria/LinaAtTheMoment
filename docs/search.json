In the context of ongoing global changes, these outcomes, like other natural hazards, have the potential to worsen. The consequences of landslides can lead to various forms of damage and, in the worst-case scenario, result in casualties. Furthermore, larger landslides inherently carry a higher probability of causing these detrimental effects.

    "text": "Geological setting\nThe geological setting of the study area is profoundly influenced by its location within the Northern Andes, where the convergence of three tectonic plates—the Nazca, Caribbean, and South American plates—gives rise to active N-NE faulting within the Andean block. This convergence, with the Nazca plate moving eastward relative to northwestern South America at a rate of 6 cm/yr, leads to the formation of the Colombia-Trench to the west and the mountain range of the Colombian Andes . Within the Colombian Andes, three distinct mountain ranges—the Western, Central, and Eastern Cordillera—converge southward into a unified range, shaped by deformation and faulting resulting from the interaction of these tectonic plates .\\ The study area, encompassing the upper Patía River basin, is situated at the southern Colombian Andes’ convergence point between the Western and Central Cordilleras. Here, the Western Cordillera rises dramatically from the Pacific Coastal Plain on its western flank, while to the east, it is separated from the Central Cordillera by the Cauca-Patia valleys spanning a distance of approximately 500 km . The Cauca-Patia valley, resembling a graben-like structure, is characterized by an asymmetric tilt and is filled with Tertiary-Quaternary continental clastics and volcanics. Bounded by the Cauca fault zone to the west and the Romeral fault zone to the east, this depression effectively separates the oceanic Western Cordillera from the ancient crystalline Central Cordillera (Figure ~\\(\\ref{fig:geomap}\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeological map of the study area.

    "text": "Global registration\nPrior to fine registration, global registration is performed, which does not require pre-alignment of point clouds. Several algorithms are available for global registration, of which RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is a widely used method (Zhou et al., 2016). The RANSAC algorithm is an iterative process that randomly selects a user-defined number of points in one point cloud and searches for their correspondence in the other point cloud. The transformation is estimated and evaluated based on criteria such as the distance correspondence between the two point clouds (Dung et al., 2013). This process is repeated until convergence. The search for correspondence in the point cloud that needs to be aligned (source point cloud) can require a significant number of iterations. To accelerate this process, Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH) are calculated (Rusu et al., 2009). FPFH describe the local geometry of a point and its neighboring points. This descriptor enables the RANSAC algorithm to search for nearest neighbors based on the FPFH, thus speeding up the correspondence search. This global registration method is implemented in the Python package Open3D.\nBesides the automatic global registration mentioned above, global registration can also be performed manually using software such as CloudCompare. User can select a set of matching points (at least three) in both the target (reference) and source point clouds. Based on this correspondence, the transformation of the source point cloud is calculated."

    "text": "ICP registration\nUnlike global alignment, fine registration methods require two point clouds that already have a rough correspondence. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is commonly used for local refinement and has two main variants:\nPoint-to-point ICP\nThe Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration method using the point-to-point variant was introduced by Besl and McKay (1992). This iterative algorithm consists of two stages in each iteration:\n\nFirst, for each point in the source point cloud, it searches for the closest point in the target point cloud.\nSecond, it attempts to find a transformation that minimizes the distance between the corresponding points.\n\nThese two processing stages are repeated until convergence (Salvi et al., 2007).\nPoint-to-plane ICP\nThe point-to-plane variant of the ICP algorithm takes into account that scanned objects are not individual points, but surfaces. Unlike point-to-point, which tries to minimize the distance between individual points, the point-to-plane method assumes that points in the source point cloud are generally on a surface of the target point cloud. This accounts for the fact that the source and target point clouds are not necessarily identical.\nThe general processing procedure of the point-to-plane method is similar to that of the point-to-point approach. However, instead of searching for the closest points between the source and target point clouds, the method calculates the intersection of the point normal in the source point cloud with the tangent plane at its corresponding point in the target point cloud. Then, the algorithm attempts to find a transformation that minimizes the distance between points and the tangent planes at its correspondence points (Low, 2004). This process is repeated until convergence.\nPulli (1999) emphasize the advantages of the point-to-plane method compared to the point-to-point method. Some of the arguments and findings are:\n\nThe point-to-plane method converges an order of magnitude faster than the point-to-point method.\nThe point-to-point method typically requires at least ten times more point matching and alignment iterations than the point-to-plane method.\nThe point-to-plane method is not significantly slowed down by false point pairs since each point can slide along the tangent plane of its corresponding point."

    "text": "Analysis\nSince fine registration requires pre-aligned point clouds, the scans with a median cloud-to-cloud distance of more than 10 cm were removed (a total of 38 scans; see Figure 6). The RANSAC global registration approach and manual point pair selection were then applied to roughly align the 38 excluded ones to the remaining scans. Two separate alignment approaches were subsequently performed using both variants of the ICP algorithm.\n\nFor the first approach, a loop closure method was implemented by starting with the first scan and aligning the second scan to the first scan. The aligned scans were merged, and the iterative process was continued by moving on to the next scan until all 222 scans were aligned and merged. To ensure a systematic approach, scans were aligned in a serpentine pattern, starting in the eastern part of the campus and continuing until the first loop was closed in the western part. Subsequently, all other scans between this serpentine pattern were aligned to the framework of the first aligned scans, resulting in the closure of the loop several times. This approach was repeated for both point-to-point and point-to-plane variants of ICP to compare their performance.\nIn the second approach, an airborne laser scanning (ALS) dataset of the campus was used as the target point cloud, and each TLS scan was aligned as the source point cloud to it. This approach was repeated for both variants of the ICP algorithm (point-to-point and point-to-plane) to compare whether a different target point cloud affected the result.\n\nThe analyses were performed using Python 3.9, utilizing two primary packages: laspy for reading and writing .laz files, and open3d for implementing the ICP algorithms. The software CloudCompare was used for manual global registration."

    "text": "Data preparation\nEach TLS scan consists of about 10 million data points. Processing such a large amount of data has a significant impact on the computation time. Therefore, each scan was subject to the following pre-processing steps prior to analysis:\n1. Subsampling to 10 centimeters\nThe subsampling of the point clouds was performed using a voxel-grid filter. This approach assigns a 3-D grid of 10 cm spacing voxels to the point cloud, and samples only the closest point to the center of each voxel. This reduces the amount of data and evens out varying point density.\n2. Outlier filter\nA statistical filter was applied to identify outliers in the point cloud. For each point, the mean distance to its n nearest neighbors was computed, and the overall standard deviation was determined. Points were classified as outliers if the mean distance to their n nearest neighbors exceeded the distance threshold of m multiplied by the overall standard deviation. For this analysis n was set to 12, and m to 3.\nAdditionally, significant noise artifacts (Figure 3) that remained after the statistical outlier filter were manually removed.\n3. Remove non-planar features\nThe Golm campus contains both planar objects such as building facades and streets, and non-planar objects like trees. Trees can have slightly varying shapes across scans due to the motion of the leaves, which potentially affects the accuracy of the ICP alignment. To mitigate this issue, non-planar objects were filtered out for the analysis by exploiting the calculation of geometric features. Geometric features, such as planarity, describe the shape of a point based on its local neighborhood. For example, a point in a tree crown would have a low planarity value, while a point on a street would have a high value.\nThe computation of the geometric feature planarity can be summarized as described by Dittrich et al. (2017):\n\nThe 3D covariance matrix based on the point’s neighborhood is calculated using a fixed radius (e.g., 1 m)\nThe eigenvectors (\\[e_{1}\\], \\[e_{2}\\], \\[e_{3}\\]) and eigenvalues (\\[\\lambda_{1}\\], \\[\\lambda_{2}\\], \\[\\lambda_{3}\\]) of the 3D covariance matrix are calculated\nPlanarity is determined considering the three eigenvalues (\\[\\lambda_{1}\\], \\[\\lambda_{2}\\], \\[\\lambda_{3}\\]): on a planar surface eigenvalues \\[\\lambda_{1}\\] and \\[\\lambda_{2}\\] are larger than \\[\\lambda_{3}\\]. Therefore, planarity (\\[P_{\\lambda}\\]) is calculated based on the following ratio: \\[  P_{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda_{2} - \\lambda_{3}}{\\lambda_{1}}\\]\n\nFor the analysis, a planarity threshold of 0.7 was selected. The value was arbitrarily chosen but led to reasonable filtering results as shown in Figure 7. As an example, Figure 7a displays the original point cloud data, while Figure 7b shows the results of the data after the data preparation stages.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Example of data preparation. Figure A displays the original point cloud data with all features included, while Figure B shows the subsampled and non-planarity filtered point cloud data."

Surface roughness is calculated as the distance between a point and the best-fitting plane determined by its nearest neighbors. If the scans overlap perfectly on a smooth surface, such as a road, the surface roughness is minimal. Conversely, the surface roughness values increase as the alignment deteriorates.\nMedian cloud-to-cloud distance\nThe median cloud-to-cloud distance was determined by merging all scans and then removing one scan position at a time for analysis. For each point in the removed scan, the distance to its nearest neighbor in the remaining scans was calculated. The median distance was calculated using all the distances. The removed scan was then merged back, and the same procedure was repeated for the next scan position. The median cloud-to-cloud distance is less affected by outliers in the point clouds.\ndRMS\nA slightly modified version of the dRMS used by Li et al. (2020) was utilized to give more weight to the misaligned and outlier points. The dRMS provides a measure of the average distance between corresponding points in two aligned point clouds. The smaller the dRMS, the higher the accuracy of the alignment. For a source point cloud A and a target (reference) point cloud B, the dRMS can be expressed as:\n\\[ dRMS(A,B)=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left ( \\left \\| a_{i}-b_{j} \\right \\| \\right )^2} \\]\nwhere:\n\n\\[a_{i}\\] is the point in the source point cloud corresponding to \\[b_{j}\\] in the target point cloud \\[n\\] the number of points in \\[A\\]"

    "text": "Fine registration\nLoop closure approach\nOverall, the point-to-point ICP variant using the loop closure approach achieved a good alignment result. Figure 9a indicates that only three scans remained above the 10 centimeter threshold for the median cloud-to-cloud distance threshold. Additionally, after visual inspection using surface roughness, it was observed that two of these scans were not misaligned but rather had poor overlap, resulting in an overall increase in cloud-to-cloud distance. Therefore, almost all scans were correctly aligned using this method, with a majority having below 5 cm cloud-to-cloud distance.\nOn the other hand, the point-to-plane ICP variant’s alignment performance was overall poor, with 87 scans having a cloud-to-cloud distance of more than 10 centimeters (Figure 9b). This method even deteriorated the initial alignment of the raw data (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of results of the loop closure approach: (A) Point-to-point variant leads to an overall good alignment result. The bars sticking out are aligned scans, however, with poor overlap and thus increased value; (B) In contrast, the point-to-plane variant showed significant misalignment for many scans, with over 80 scans having a median cloud-to-cloud distance greater than 10 cm.\n\n\n\nALS reference approach\nIn the case of using the ALS data set as the reference point cloud, the point-to-point ICP variant had a slightly worse alignment performance compared to the loop closure approach, as depicted in Figure 10a. Despite this, the point-to-point approach still resulted in an improvement over the alignment of the raw data, with 18 scans having a median cloud-to-cloud distance greater than 10 centimeters. The scans displayed good alignment agreement along the z-direction but showed deficient alignment in the x- and y-directions, particularly along building walls.\nThe point-to-plane ICP variant performed better compared to the loop closure approach, with 28 scans exhibiting a median cloud-to-cloud distance greater than 10 centimeters (Figure 10b). However, the point-to-plane variant still underperformed in comparison to the point-to-point variant.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of results of the ALS reference approach: (A) Point-to-point variant shows misalignment only for individual scans, particularly scan 180-200 where building walls are poorly represented; (B) Point-to-plane variant shows misalignment for more scans, with five scans having a median cloud-to-cloud distance greater than 1 m.\n\n\n\nOverall performance and final 3-D model\nThe overall performance of the two ICP variants and the two alignment approaches are shown in the table below. The evaluation metrics, including the dRMS and median cloud-to-cloud distance, suggest that the point-to-point ICP variant using the loop closure approach performed best in this analysis. Additionally, the point-to-point ALS reference approach also demonstrated reasonable results.

However, this method shows lower accuracy in the x- and y-directions, which is likely due to the fact that the ALS dataset does not sufficiently represent the facades of the buildings.\nFor future work, a combination of the loop closure and ALS reference approaches could be beneficial to improve the overall alignment. The loop closure approach could be used first to align the point clouds in the x- and y-directions, followed by the ALS approach to refine the alignment only in the z-direction."

    "text": "Point-to-point vs. point-to-plane ICP\nGiven the conditions of this project, the point-to-point ICP algorithm outperformed the point-to-plane ICP algorithm and resulted in an overall improvement of the registered data compared to the raw data. Considering the significant number of scans that were misaligned after the data acquisition, the point-to-point algorithm was able to refine the registration with an accuracy of centimeters to millimeters. The removal of non-planar and slightly moving features, such as leaves or branches, proved to be beneficial for the algorithm. This is because the point-to-point variant of the ICP algorithm aims to find identical points in two different point clouds, making it more effective to use only man-made features that are consistent across the scans.\nWhile the point-to-point variant yielded superior results, the point-to-plane variant underperformed and even deteriorated the raw data alignment. This result was unexpected given that the point-to-plane variant is commonly regarded as more realistic due to the challenge of identifying identical points in two distinct point clouds. The inaccurate outcomes of the point-to-plane algorithm can be attributed to two main factors:\n\nRestricting the point clouds to planar surfaces was effective for the point-to-point variant but may not have been optimal for the point-to-plane variant. The campus environment, consisting of buildings with large walls lacking distinctive features, posed a challenge for the point-to-plane variant. As a result, the algorithm had difficulty in finding matching features, resulting in the slipping of two large walls.\nThe algorithm randomly oriented the point normals of the point clouds. Figure 12 shows an example of a point cloud with three walls and their corresponding point normals. Ideally, all point normals should face the direction of the scanner. However, since the scanner’s location was not specified, the point normals were randomly oriented in both possible directions. Consequently, the algorithm projected the point normals onto the planes of non-corresponding points, causing significant shifts in the x- and y-directions, as observed in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Figure A is showing a point cloud with three walls and their computed normals in Figure B"

    "text": "Impact of the TLS sampling pattern on alignment performance\nThe RIEGL VZ-400i and other similar scanners are equipped with onboard alignment capabilities, which can eliminate the need for post-processing alignment if a suitable sampling pattern is employed. However, as mentioned in the introduction, the scanner’s alignment capabilities are limited when either the GNSS or IMU system is not performing as expected, often due to factors such as weak signal strength, large distances between scans, or the absence of re-initialization at the last scan position after the scanner is turned off. The combined effect of these factors can lead to the alignment issues encountered after the data acquisition in this project.\nWhile this project demonstrated that misalignment issues in a large data set with over 200 scans can be resolved through global alignment and refined alignment using ICP, these processing steps can be avoided or simplified with consistent TLS sampling. Two crucial aspects to consider are short distances (10-20 m) between scans and a consistent sampling pattern in which each scan has a follow-up scan and no location is scanned more than once. Short distance ensures adequate overlap of point clouds from different scans, enabling matching of the same objects during alignment. A consistent scan pattern is essential for proper alignment of subsequent scans, as jumping back and forth between scans can disrupt onboard alignment and potentially lead to misalignment. Keeping these considerations in mind when conducting TLS scanning can help streamline the alignment process and ensure obtaining an accurate 3-D model."
