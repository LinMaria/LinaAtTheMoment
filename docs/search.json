    "text": "Landslides are natural disasters with devastating impacts on human communities. Like other natural hazards, their severity can escalate, especially with ongoing global climate change. Moreover, larger landslides can result in diverse forms of damage and, in the worst-case scenario, casualties. To address these challenges, advanced technologies such as UAV-based photogrammetry and LiDAR are currently being utilized to assess large landslides rapidly and cost-effectively. However, the precise georeferencing, co-registration, and alignment of UAV surveys collected from different devices with varying resolutions and coverage present significant challenges for data analysis. To tackle these challenges, this work explores different methods to ensure accuracy in the pre-processing of this type of data."

    "text": "Geological setting\nThe geological setting of the study area is profoundly influenced by its location within the Northern Andes, where the convergence of three tectonic plates—the Nazca, Caribbean, and South American plates—gives rise to active N-NE faulting within the Andean block. This convergence, with the Nazca plate moving eastward relative to northwestern South America at a rate of 6 cm/yr, leads to the formation of the Colombia-Trench to the west and the mountain range of the Colombian Andes Pulido (2003). Within the Colombian Andes, three distinct mountain ranges—the Western, Central, and Eastern Cordillera—converge southward into a unified range, shaped by deformation and faulting resulting from the interaction of these tectonic plates Taboada et al. (2000). The study area, encompassing the upper Patía River basin, is situated at the southern Colombian Andes’ convergence point between the Western and Central Cordilleras. Here, the Western Cordillera rises dramatically from the Pacific Coastal Plain on its western flank, while to the east, it is separated from the Central Cordillera by the Cauca-Patia valleys spanning a distance of approximately 500 km. The Cauca-Patia valley, resembling a graben-like structure, is characterized by an asymmetric tilt and is filled with Tertiary-Quaternary continental clastics and volcanics. Bounded by the Cauca fault zone to the west and the Romeral fault zone to the east, this depression effectively separates the oceanic Western Cordillera from the ancient crystalline Central Cordillera (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Geological map of the study area.

    "text": "Point Cloud Generation\nThe Structure from Motion (SfM) method uses algorithms to identify matching features in a series of overlapping digital images and calculates camera location and orientation from the differential positions of multiple matched features. From these calculations, overlapping imagery is then used to reconstruct a “sparse” or “coarse” 3D point cloud model of the photographed object or surface or scene. Brook et al. (2019). The software Agisoft Metashape was used to undertake the SfM processing. In Metashape, the SFM processing comprises three key steps Agisoft (2023):\n\nAlignment: Involves aerial triangulation and bundle block adjustment, where the software identifies feature points on images, matches them into tie points and determine camera positions, resulting in a tie point cloud and camera positions for depth map determination and 3D reconstruction.\nSurface Generation: Creates a 3D mesh or 2.5D digital elevation model (DEM), combining photogrammetric depth maps and LiDAR data, which can be textured and exported for various applications.\nOrthomosaic Creation: Generates a georeferenced orthomosaic by projecting images onto a chosen surface (DEM or mesh), useful for mapping and analysis, including vegetation indices in multispectral imagery projects.\n\nIn this study we adopted the workflow implemented in Agisoft Metashape, described in the User Manual v2.0 Agisoft (2023). The parameters used are described n the following sections."

    "text": "Natural points definition and GNSS survey\nTo accurately reference the point clouds, a series of natural markers were established to guarantee high-precision (centimeter-level) localization that was readily identifiable in the field. Utilized reference points included distinct features such as sewer edges, fence corners, and light posts (see Figure 9). Out of the 27 natural markers delineated (see Figure 10), only 21 were successfully surveyed on-site. The survey faced several challenges, including the demolition of referenced structures, obscuring of markers by debris or soil, and inaccessible locations of certain points. The coordinates for each marker were recorded using a Trimble SPS855 GNSS Modular Receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Example of a marker defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Markers defined\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the download of raw data from the Trimble receiver, the post-processing software GrafNav was employed. GrafNav is an advanced GNSS post-processing suite that supports kinematic and static analysis with an advanced processing engine for GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou signals. To refine the data, corrections were applied using the Popayan station (POPA), which is the station nearest to the collection site. The required data were acquired from the Colombian open data portal (https://www.colombiaenmapas.gov.co/). Both the RINEX files from the field-surveyed markers and the permanent station were inputted into GrafNav to execute the correction process. The precision-adjusted positions of the markers are shown in Table 2 and Figure 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Points depict the resulting standard deviation for horizontal and height measurements, while bars illustrate a quality metric established by GrafNav.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 11, both the resulting horizontal and vertical standard deviations are below 0.656 meters, with mean values of 0.26 and 0.14 meters, respectively. Achieving accuracy at the centimeter level indicates favorable results. However, a metric of quality provided by Grafnav offers additional insight. This metric assigns values as follows:\n\nQuality 1: Represents a fixed integer solution with excellent satellite geometry.\nQuality 2-3: Indicates either fixed integers with marginal geometry or converging float solutions.\nQuality 4-5: Suggests qualities akin to those of DGPS.\nQuality 6: Represents a coarse acquisition (C/A) only solution.\n\nThe majority of solutions fall within the quality range of 2-3, with one solution (marker 1) exhibiting a very good quality of 1 and another (marker 10) displaying a poor quality of 6. All solutions showed satisfactory results and were subsequently utilized in the following step, which involvs the precise alignment of point clouds based on markers.\n\n\n\nTable 2: GNSS data corrected in Grafnav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nGPSTime\nEasting\nNorthing\nH-Ell\nH-MSL\nQ\nSDHoriz\nSDHeigh (m)\nMarker\n\n\n\n\n8/09/2023\n32:23.0\n302995,460\n248590,161\n1514963\n1486998\n1\n0,016\n0,028\n1\n\n\n8/09/2023\n59:34.0\n302445,401\n247995,626\n1346507\n1318573\n3\n0,12\n0,072\n12\n\n\n8/09/2023\n32:47.0\n302540,380\n247938,191\n1342117\n1314170\n5\n0,559\n0,402\n13\n\n\n8/09/2023\n50:24.0\n302928,080\n248596,004\n1508566\n1480608\n3\n0,18\n0,112\n2\n\n\n8/09/2023\n01:48.0\n302956,219\n248607,942\n1512854\n1484894\n4\n0,367\n0,129\n25\n\n\n8/09/2023\n25:50.0\n302984,155\n248601,450\n1513498\n1485535\n5\n0,257\n0,13\n3\n\n\n8/10/2023\n53:34.0\n302155,060\n247741,470\n1338077\n1310161\n6\n0,291\n0,181\n10\n\n\n8/10/2023\n26:29.0\n302045,545\n247650,392\n1328182\n1300273\n3\n0,347\n0,215\n21\n\n\n8/10/2023\n29:50.0\n302207,493\n247767,666\n1341687\n1313767\n2\n0,243\n0,138\n23\n\n\n8/10/2023\n03:19.0\n302229,752\n247892,380\n1344103\n1316187\n3\n0,343\n0,217\n24\n\n\n8/10/2023\n10:53.0\n301981,062\n248881,942\n1547867\n1520018\n3\n0,263\n0,137\n26\n\n\n8/10/2023\n58:14.0\n301798,636\n248108,698\n1446887\n1419024\n3\n0,19\n0,117\n4\n\n\n8/10/2023\n09:31.0\n301847,911\n248155,130\n1446869\n1419003\n3\n0,364\n0,186\n6\n\n\n8/10/2023\n31:22.0\n301868,008\n248170,170\n1446827\n1418960\n3\n0,147\n0,072\n7\n\n\n8/10/2023\n30:20.0\n301875,048\n248297,576\n1452434\n1424571\n3\n0,235\n0,161\n8\n\n\n8/10/2023\n00:47.0\n301968,070\n248386,332\n1451916\n1424048\n4\n0,235\n0,09\n9\n\n\n8/11/2023\n58:29.0\n301263,276\n246688,966\n1308378\n1280506\n4\n0,656\n0,64\n17\n\n\n8/11/2023\n40:23.0\n301456,505\n246350,882\n1292738\n1264830\n2\n0,054\n0,055\n18\n\n\n8/11/2023\n04:19.0\n301430,773\n246394,964\n1296034\n1268131\n2\n0,077\n0,064\n19\n\n\n8/11/2023\n30:58.0\n301364,741\n246498,245\n1300102\n1272211\n4\n0,364\n0,259\n20\n\n\n8/11/2023\n34:20.0\n301586,893\n247430,776\n1319567\n1291696\n5\n0,604\n0,323\n27"

    "text": "ICP registration\nUnlike global alignment, fine registration methods require two point clouds that already have a rough correspondence. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is commonly used for local refinement and has two main variants:\nPoint-to-point ICP\nThe Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration method using the point-to-point variant was introduced by Besl and McKay (1992). This iterative algorithm consists of two stages in each iteration:\n\nFirst, for each point in the source point cloud, it searches for the closest point in the target point cloud.\nSecond, it attempts to find a transformation that minimizes the distance between the corresponding points.\n\nThese two processing stages are repeated until convergence (Salvi et al., 2007).\nPoint-to-plane ICP\nThe point-to-plane variant of the ICP algorithm takes into account that scanned objects are not individual points, but surfaces. Unlike point-to-point, which tries to minimize the distance between individual points, the point-to-plane method assumes that points in the source point cloud are generally on a surface of the target point cloud. This accounts for the fact that the source and target point clouds are not necessarily identical.\nThe general processing procedure of the point-to-plane method is similar to that of the point-to-point approach. However, instead of searching for the closest points between the source and target point clouds, the method calculates the intersection of the point normal in the source point cloud with the tangent plane at its corresponding point in the target point cloud. Then, the algorithm attempts to find a transformation that minimizes the distance between points and the tangent planes at its correspondence points (Low, 2004). This process is repeated until convergence.\nPulli (1999) emphasize the advantages of the point-to-plane method compared to the point-to-point method. Some of the arguments and findings are:\n\nThe point-to-plane method converges an order of magnitude faster than the point-to-point method.\nThe point-to-point method typically requires at least ten times more point matching and alignment iterations than the point-to-plane method.\nThe point-to-plane method is not significantly slowed down by false point pairs since each point can slide along the tangent plane of its corresponding point."
