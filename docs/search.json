    "text": "Landslides are natural disasters with devastating impacts on human communities. Like other natural hazards, their severity can escalate, especially with ongoing global climate change. Moreover, larger landslides can result in diverse forms of damage and, in the worst-case scenario, casualties. To address these challenges, advanced technologies such as UAV-based photogrammetry and LiDAR are currently being utilized to assess large landslides rapidly and cost-effectively. However, the precise georeferencing, co-registration, and alignment of UAV surveys collected from different devices with varying resolutions and coverage present significant challenges for data analysis. To tackle these challenges, this work explores different methods to ensure accuracy in the pre-processing of this type of data."

    "text": "Geology and failure surface\nThe initial phase of the mass movement was characterized by a rotational slide, evidenced by a semicircular curved and concave upward rupture surface. This phase exposed a steep slope scarp reaching heights of up to 40 meters (SGC (2023)), composed of alternating layers of residual ash soils and pyroclastic flows from the Galeón Formation. Subsequently, a portion of the body adjacent to the crown tilted backward due to the concavity of the failure surface, resulting in ground subsidence. When the central region of the landslide became fully saturated with water, copious flows of earth and rock emanated from both sides of the landslide, as well as from its center.\nIn the microbasin of Chontaduro creek, a geological sequence unfolds, comprising both epiclastic and volcanic rocks attributed to the Galeón Formation (TQpg). Notably, these formations are prominently exposed in areas such as Cerro Broncazo and its environs, encompassing the Quilcacé and Esmita rivers. In these regions, the volcaniclastic deposits can attain substantial thicknesses, reaching up to 800 meters (SGC rosas 25k).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Lithological sequence and unit details observed at the crown of the landslide\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scarp of the crown provided a clear view of the sequential arrangement of materials comprising the mobilized mass. Illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 6, from bottom to top, the lithological units are delineated as follows:\n\nThe base layer showcases rocks attributed to well-selected, sandy, hyperconcentrated lahar deposits, linked with the Galeón formation.\nDirectly above lies a layer of clast-supported pyroclastic flows, featuring rounded volcanic rock clasts with subtle orientation indicative of flow, ensconced within a reddish sandy volcanic ash matrix.\nProgressing upward, there exist lenticular alluvial and colluvial deposits, resulting from the erosion and transportation of various units within the Galeón formation.\nFinally, at the apex of the sequence, residual soils stemming from both transport deposits and pyroclastic flows are evident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Panoramic view of landslide crown scarp. Blue dashed line depicting the water horizon\n\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 6, a highly saturated surface conducive to water flow manifests between the hyperconcentrated flow layer and the pyroclastic flow layer. The permeability of the latter, coupled with the slight permeability of the underlying layer, facilitates water flow across this contact surface. Exhibiting horizontal continuity, this surface could be associated with the sliding surface of the mass movement.Recurrence of the poorly permeable hyperconcentrated lahar layer is notable at the base of the slide, indicating a seamless continuation of the water-saturated surface from the crown to the landslide’s base.\nFurthermore, noteworthy is the close proximity of the landslide’s crown to the ‘Alto de las Yerbas’ fault line, as referenced in the technical report on Landslide Hazard Zoning by the SGC (2020), detailed in Figure 7. Findings from the present study imply that structural and lithological factors, compounded by intense rainfall, were the primary catalysts for the occurrence of this significant landslide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Geological surface units and main fault in the landslide site.

Rainfall patterns indicate a distinct summer season during June, July, August, and September, followed by a rainy season during the remaining months. The precipitation data for the study area was obtained from the Párraga weather station (Station Code: 52010050), which is managed by IDEAM (Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales de Colombia). The time series analyzed encompasses 33 years of recorded data, spanning from 1990 to 2023 (Figure 8 shows the last 20 years of data). As shown in Figure 8, the study area experiences two distinct rainy seasons: the first occurs from January to May, characterized by relatively lower rainfall compared to the second rainy season, which typically occurs between October and December.\nAn important observation to highlight is that within the last 20 years of recorded data, the rainfall during the rainy season of December 2022, preceding the event, was notably exceptional. In November 2022 alone, precipitation levels reached a record high of up to 720 mm, marking it as the highest recorded rainfall within the observed period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Visualization of total monthly rainfall at the Parraga meteorological station spanning the past 20 years. Blue bars represent months with rainfall above the mean, while green bars denote months with precipitation below the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the other hand, the daily time series recorded at the Párraga station exhibits a range of maximum daily precipitation values, varying between 0 mm and 95 mm. The highest recorded value, 94.8 mm, was documented on January 9th, which coincided with the onset of the landslide event (Figure 9). The cumulative rainfall data was computed over the last 60 days leading up to the triggering of the landslide, revealing an impressive total rainfall accumulation of 2309.3 millimeters recorded up to January 9, 2023 (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Total daily and accumulated rainfall at the Parraga meteorological station."

    "text": "Natural points definition and GNSS survey\nTo accurately reference the point clouds, a series of natural markers were established to guarantee high-precision (centimeter-level) localization that was readily identifiable in the field. Utilized reference points included distinct features such as sewer edges, fence corners, and light posts (see Figure 12). Out of the 27 natural markers delineated (see Figure 13), only 21 were successfully surveyed on-site. The survey faced several challenges, including the demolition of referenced structures, obscuring of markers by debris or soil, and inaccessible locations of certain points. The coordinates for each marker were recorded using a Trimble SPS855 GNSS Modular Receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Example of a marker defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Markers defined\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the download of raw data from the Trimble receiver, the post-processing software GrafNav was employed. GrafNav is an advanced GNSS post-processing suite that supports kinematic and static analysis with an advanced processing engine for GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou signals. To refine the data, corrections were applied using the Popayan station (POPA), which is the station nearest to the collection site. The required data were acquired from the Colombian open data portal (https://www.colombiaenmapas.gov.co/). Both the RINEX files from the field-surveyed markers and the permanent station were inputted into GrafNav to execute the correction process. The precision-adjusted positions of the markers are shown in Table 2 and Figure 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Points depict the resulting standard deviation for horizontal and height measurements, while bars illustrate a quality metric established by GrafNav.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 14, both the resulting horizontal and vertical standard deviations are below 0.656 meters, with mean values of 0.26 and 0.14 meters, respectively. Achieving accuracy at the centimeter level indicates favorable results. However, a metric of quality provided by Grafnav offers additional insight. This metric assigns values as follows:\n\nQuality 1: Represents a fixed integer solution with excellent satellite geometry.\nQuality 2-3: Indicates either fixed integers with marginal geometry or converging float solutions.\nQuality 4-5: Suggests qualities akin to those of DGPS.\nQuality 6: Represents a coarse acquisition (C/A) only solution.\n\nThe majority of solutions fall within the quality range of 2-3, with one solution (marker 1) exhibiting a very good quality of 1 and another (marker 10) displaying a poor quality of 6. All solutions showed satisfactory results and were subsequently utilized in the following step, which involvs the precise alignment of point clouds based on markers.\n\n\n\nTable 2: GNSS data corrected in Grafnav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nGPSTime\nEasting\nNorthing\nH-Ell\nH-MSL\nQ\nSDHoriz\nSDHeigh (m)\nMarker\n\n\n\n\n8/09/2023\n32:23.0\n302995,460\n248590,161\n1514963\n1486998\n1\n0,016\n0,028\n1\n\n\n8/09/2023\n59:34.0\n302445,401\n247995,626\n1346507\n1318573\n3\n0,12\n0,072\n12\n\n\n8/09/2023\n32:47.0\n302540,380\n247938,191\n1342117\n1314170\n5\n0,559\n0,402\n13\n\n\n8/09/2023\n50:24.0\n302928,080\n248596,004\n1508566\n1480608\n3\n0,18\n0,112\n2\n\n\n8/09/2023\n01:48.0\n302956,219\n248607,942\n1512854\n1484894\n4\n0,367\n0,129\n25\n\n\n8/09/2023\n25:50.0\n302984,155\n248601,450\n1513498\n1485535\n5\n0,257\n0,13\n3\n\n\n8/10/2023\n53:34.0\n302155,060\n247741,470\n1338077\n1310161\n6\n0,291\n0,181\n10\n\n\n8/10/2023\n26:29.0\n302045,545\n247650,392\n1328182\n1300273\n3\n0,347\n0,215\n21\n\n\n8/10/2023\n29:50.0\n302207,493\n247767,666\n1341687\n1313767\n2\n0,243\n0,138\n23\n\n\n8/10/2023\n03:19.0\n302229,752\n247892,380\n1344103\n1316187\n3\n0,343\n0,217\n24\n\n\n8/10/2023\n10:53.0\n301981,062\n248881,942\n1547867\n1520018\n3\n0,263\n0,137\n26\n\n\n8/10/2023\n58:14.0\n301798,636\n248108,698\n1446887\n1419024\n3\n0,19\n0,117\n4\n\n\n8/10/2023\n09:31.0\n301847,911\n248155,130\n1446869\n1419003\n3\n0,364\n0,186\n6\n\n\n8/10/2023\n31:22.0\n301868,008\n248170,170\n1446827\n1418960\n3\n0,147\n0,072\n7\n\n\n8/10/2023\n30:20.0\n301875,048\n248297,576\n1452434\n1424571\n3\n0,235\n0,161\n8\n\n\n8/10/2023\n00:47.0\n301968,070\n248386,332\n1451916\n1424048\n4\n0,235\n0,09\n9\n\n\n8/11/2023\n58:29.0\n301263,276\n246688,966\n1308378\n1280506\n4\n0,656\n0,64\n17\n\n\n8/11/2023\n40:23.0\n301456,505\n246350,882\n1292738\n1264830\n2\n0,054\n0,055\n18\n\n\n8/11/2023\n04:19.0\n301430,773\n246394,964\n1296034\n1268131\n2\n0,077\n0,064\n19\n\n\n8/11/2023\n30:58.0\n301364,741\n246498,245\n1300102\n1272211\n4\n0,364\n0,259\n20\n\n\n8/11/2023\n34:20.0\n301586,893\n247430,776\n1319567\n1291696\n5\n0,604\n0,323\n27"

    "text": "Pre-processing and Global registration\nThe registration process was exclusively conducted within the stable zones identified within the study area. By avoiding regions experiencing landslide activity, where the terrain undergoes constant changes, we ensure a precise correlation between zones exhibiting minimal alterations over time. The stable areas from both the reference and target point clouds were manually selected and extracted using Cloud Compare.\nSubsequently, pre-registration steps were performed on these stable area point clouds, including:\n\nInitial Filtering Step: This involved the removal of statistical outliers using an Open3D function. Points that deviate significantly from the average distance to their neighbors were identified as outliers and removed. This step was iterated until all points not forming a continuous surface were eliminated.\nNearest Neighbor Distance Calculation: Next, KDtree was employed to compute the nearest neighbor distances between both point clouds (Figure 15). In some regions where there was a lack of overlapping between the point clouds, resulting distances exceeded 3 meters. To address this issue and ensure complete overlap, points farther than 3 meters from one point cloud to the other were filtered out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Nearest neighbor distances between both point clouds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the initial filtering step, the alignment process proceeds with an initial coarse alignment to bring the point clouds into close proximity. This alignment method incorporates feature identification to refine the search for corresponding points. This process generally involves two key steps:\n\nUtilizing Fast Point Feature Histograms (FPFH): FPFH is a technique employed in 3D registration, which aims to align multiple 3D point clouds. FPFH analyzes each point in a 3D point cloud by examining its surrounding points. It computes a histogram describing the geometric features of each point based on its neighbors, encompassing attributes like angle and distance between neighboring points. FPFH facilitates the matching of points across different 3D scenes by leveraging the geometric properties of each point and its surroundings (Rusu et al. (2011)).\nApplication of registration_ransac_based_on_feature_matching Function: Open3D’s registration_ransac_based_on_feature_matching function implements the RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm tailored for point cloud registration via feature matching. RANSAC randomly selects a minimal subset of points from both point clouds to estimate a transformation, such as rotation and translation, between them (Fischler et al. (1981)). Subsequently, the estimated transformation is evaluated by applying it to all feature correspondences obtained in the previous step, and the number of inliers—correspondences consistent with the estimated transformation—is tallied.\n\nIn essence, these refined alignment techniques enable the accurate registration of point clouds by iteratively estimating transformations based on feature correspondences, thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of the alignment process. Although the global alignment has improved the distribution of distances, as depicted in Figure 16, with a mean value of less than 2 meters, the Global Registration Modified Hausdorff Distance has increased to 3.75 meters. This discrepancy underscores the necessity for a more precise registration process to minimize the offset between the two point clouds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Nearest neighbor distances between both point clouds before and after global registration."

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is commonly used for local refinement and has two main variants:\nPoint-to-point ICP\nThe Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, introduced in the early 1990s by various authors (Besl et al. (1992), Chen et al. (1992), Zhang (1994)), stands out among the myriad registration methods proposed in the literature. It has become one of the most well-known for efficiently registering two 2D or 3D point sets under Euclidean (rigid) transformation.\nThe process follows a simple concept (Yang et al. (2015)):\n\nBegin with an initial transformation involving rotation and translation.\nAlternate between two steps:\n\nEstablish closest-point correspondences under the current transformation.\nEstimate a new transformation using these correspondences.\n\nRepeat steps 2a and 2b until convergence is achieved.\n\nNotably, the point-to-point ICP method is capable of directly processing the raw point sets without regard to their inherent characteristics, such as distribution, density, and noise level.\nThe registration_icp function of Open3D aligns both stable-area point clouds using the global transformation matrix from the previous step via ICP registration. subsequently, we use the evaluate_registration function that calculates two key metrics: Fitness, that measures overlapping area (# of inlier correspondences / # of points in target), higher values indicate better alignment. And Inlier RMSE, that measures RMSE of all inlier correspondences with lower values indicating better alignment.\nAs depicted in Figure 17, the final registration demonstrates excellent performance, with mean distances smaller than 50 centimeters. Subsequently, the final transformation matrix derived from this registration is applied to the full dataset, encompassing both stable and landslide areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Nearest neighbor distances between both point clouds before and after global registration and ICP registration.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 3, a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of various registration methods in enhancing the alignment of point clouds is provided.
