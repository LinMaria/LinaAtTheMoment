    "text": "Landslides are natural disasters with devastating impacts on human communities. Like other natural hazards, their severity can escalate, especially with ongoing global climate change. Moreover, larger landslides can result in diverse forms of damage and, in the worst-case scenario, casualties. To address these challenges, advanced technologies such as UAV-based photogrammetry and LiDAR are currently being utilized to assess large landslides rapidly and cost-effectively. However, the precise georeferencing, co-registration, and alignment of UAV surveys collected from different devices with varying resolutions and coverage present significant challenges for data analysis. To tackle these challenges, this work explores different methods to ensure accuracy in the pre-processing of this type of data."

    "text": "Geology and failure surface\nThe initial phase of the mass movement was characterized by a rotational slide, evidenced by a semicircular curved and concave upward rupture surface. This phase exposed a steep slope scarp reaching heights of up to 40 meters (SGC (2023)), composed of alternating layers of residual ash soils and pyroclastic flows from the Galeón Formation. Subsequently, a portion of the body adjacent to the crown tilted backward due to the concavity of the failure surface, resulting in ground subsidence. When the central region of the landslide became fully saturated with water, copious flows of earth and rock emanated from both sides of the landslide, as well as from its center.\nIn the microbasin of Chontaduro creek, a geological sequence unfolds, comprising both epiclastic and volcanic rocks attributed to the Galeón Formation (TQpg). Notably, these formations are prominently exposed in areas such as Cerro Broncazo and its environs, encompassing the Quilcacé and Esmita rivers. In these regions, the volcaniclastic deposits can attain substantial thicknesses, reaching up to 800 meters (SGC rosas 25k).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Lithological sequence and unit details observed at the crown of the landslide\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scarp of the crown provided a clear view of the sequential arrangement of materials comprising the mobilized mass. Illustrated in Figure 5, from bottom to top, the lithological units are delineated as follows:\n\nThe base layer showcases rocks attributed to well-selected, sandy, hyperconcentrated lahar deposits, linked with the Galeón formation.\nDirectly above lies a layer of clast-supported pyroclastic flows, featuring rounded volcanic rock clasts with subtle orientation indicative of flow, ensconced within a reddish sandy volcanic ash matrix.\nProgressing upward, there exist lenticular alluvial and colluvial deposits, resulting from the erosion and transportation of various units within the Galeón formation.\nFinally, at the apex of the sequence, residual soils stemming from both transport deposits and pyroclastic flows are evident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Panoramic view of landslide crown scarp. Blue dashed line depicting the water horizon\n\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 6, a highly saturated surface conducive to water flow manifests between the hyperconcentrated flow layer and the pyroclastic flow layer. The permeability of the latter, coupled with the slight permeability of the underlying layer, facilitates water flow across this contact surface. Exhibiting horizontal continuity, this surface could be associated with the sliding surface of the mass movement.Recurrence of the poorly permeable hyperconcentrated lahar layer is notable at the base of the slide, indicating a seamless continuation of the water-saturated surface from the crown to the landslide’s base.\nFurthermore, noteworthy is the close proximity of the landslide’s crown to the ‘Alto de las Yerbas’ fault line, as referenced in the technical report on Landslide Hazard Zoning by the SGC (2020), detailed in Figure 7. Findings from the present study imply that structural and lithological factors, compounded by intense rainfall, were the primary catalysts for the occurrence of this significant landslide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Geological surface units and main fault in the landslide site.

Rainfall patterns indicate a distinct summer season during June, July, August, and September, followed by a rainy season during the remaining months. The precipitation data for the study area was obtained from the Párraga weather station (Station Code: 52010050), which is managed by IDEAM (Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales de Colombia). The time series analyzed encompasses 33 years of recorded data, spanning from 1990 to 2023 (Figure 3). The study region experiences two distinct rainy seasons: the first occurs from January to May, characterized by relatively lower rainfall compared to the second rainy season, which typically occurs between October and December.\nThe daily time series recorded at the Párraga station exhibits a range of maximum daily precipitation values, varying between 0 mm and 95 mm. The highest recorded value, 94.8 mm, was documented on January 9th, which coincided with the onset of the landslide event (Figure 8). The cumulative rainfall data is meticulously computed over the 30-day period leading up to the triggering of the landslide, revealing an impressive total rainfall accumulation of 539.8 millimeters recorded up to January 9, 2023 (Figure 9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Total monthly rainfall at the Parraga meteorological station over the past 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Total daily and accumulated rainfall at the Parraga meteorological station."

    "text": "Point Cloud Generation\nThe Structure from Motion (SfM) method uses algorithms to identify matching features in a series of overlapping digital images and calculates camera location and orientation from the differential positions of multiple matched features. From these calculations, overlapping imagery is then used to reconstruct a “sparse” or “coarse” 3D point cloud model of the photographed object or surface or scene. Brook et al. (2019). The software Agisoft Metashape was used to undertake the SfM processing. In Metashape, the SFM processing comprises three key steps Agisoft (2023):\n\nAlignment: Involves aerial triangulation and bundle block adjustment, where the software identifies feature points on images, matches them into tie points and determine camera positions, resulting in a tie point cloud and camera positions for depth map determination and 3D reconstruction.\nSurface Generation: Creates a 3D mesh or 2.5D digital elevation model (DEM), combining photogrammetric depth maps and LiDAR data, which can be textured and exported for various applications.\nOrthomosaic Creation: Generates a georeferenced orthomosaic by projecting images onto a chosen surface (DEM or mesh), useful for mapping and analysis, including vegetation indices in multispectral imagery projects.\n\nIn this study we adopted the workflow implemented in Agisoft Metashape, described in the User Manual v2.0 Agisoft (2023).

    "text": "Natural points definition and GNSS survey\nTo accurately reference the point clouds, a series of natural markers were established to guarantee high-precision (centimeter-level) localization that was readily identifiable in the field. Utilized reference points included distinct features such as sewer edges, fence corners, and light posts (see Figure 12). Out of the 27 natural markers delineated (see Figure 13), only 21 were successfully surveyed on-site. The survey faced several challenges, including the demolition of referenced structures, obscuring of markers by debris or soil, and inaccessible locations of certain points. The coordinates for each marker were recorded using a Trimble SPS855 GNSS Modular Receiver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Example of a marker defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Markers defined\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the download of raw data from the Trimble receiver, the post-processing software GrafNav was employed. GrafNav is an advanced GNSS post-processing suite that supports kinematic and static analysis with an advanced processing engine for GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou signals. To refine the data, corrections were applied using the Popayan station (POPA), which is the station nearest to the collection site. The required data were acquired from the Colombian open data portal (https://www.colombiaenmapas.gov.co/). Both the RINEX files from the field-surveyed markers and the permanent station were inputted into GrafNav to execute the correction process. The precision-adjusted positions of the markers are shown in Table 2 and Figure 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Points depict the resulting standard deviation for horizontal and height measurements, while bars illustrate a quality metric established by GrafNav.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs depicted in Figure 14, both the resulting horizontal and vertical standard deviations are below 0.656 meters, with mean values of 0.26 and 0.14 meters, respectively. Achieving accuracy at the centimeter level indicates favorable results. However, a metric of quality provided by Grafnav offers additional insight. This metric assigns values as follows:\n\nQuality 1: Represents a fixed integer solution with excellent satellite geometry.\nQuality 2-3: Indicates either fixed integers with marginal geometry or converging float solutions.\nQuality 4-5: Suggests qualities akin to those of DGPS.\nQuality 6: Represents a coarse acquisition (C/A) only solution.\n\nThe majority of solutions fall within the quality range of 2-3, with one solution (marker 1) exhibiting a very good quality of 1 and another (marker 10) displaying a poor quality of 6. All solutions showed satisfactory results and were subsequently utilized in the following step, which involvs the precise alignment of point clouds based on markers.\n\n\n\nTable 2: GNSS data corrected in Grafnav\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nGPSTime\nEasting\nNorthing\nH-Ell\nH-MSL\nQ\nSDHoriz\nSDHeigh (m)\nMarker\n\n\n\n\n8/09/2023\n32:23.0\n302995,460\n248590,161\n1514963\n1486998\n1\n0,016\n0,028\n1\n\n\n8/09/2023\n59:34.0\n302445,401\n247995,626\n1346507\n1318573\n3\n0,12\n0,072\n12\n\n\n8/09/2023\n32:47.0\n302540,380\n247938,191\n1342117\n1314170\n5\n0,559\n0,402\n13\n\n\n8/09/2023\n50:24.0\n302928,080\n248596,004\n1508566\n1480608\n3\n0,18\n0,112\n2\n\n\n8/09/2023\n01:48.0\n302956,219\n248607,942\n1512854\n1484894\n4\n0,367\n0,129\n25\n\n\n8/09/2023\n25:50.0\n302984,155\n248601,450\n1513498\n1485535\n5\n0,257\n0,13\n3\n\n\n8/10/2023\n53:34.0\n302155,060\n247741,470\n1338077\n1310161\n6\n0,291\n0,181\n10\n\n\n8/10/2023\n26:29.0\n302045,545\n247650,392\n1328182\n1300273\n3\n0,347\n0,215\n21\n\n\n8/10/2023\n29:50.0\n302207,493\n247767,666\n1341687\n1313767\n2\n0,243\n0,138\n23\n\n\n8/10/2023\n03:19.0\n302229,752\n247892,380\n1344103\n1316187\n3\n0,343\n0,217\n24\n\n\n8/10/2023\n10:53.0\n301981,062\n248881,942\n1547867\n1520018\n3\n0,263\n0,137\n26\n\n\n8/10/2023\n58:14.0\n301798,636\n248108,698\n1446887\n1419024\n3\n0,19\n0,117\n4\n\n\n8/10/2023\n09:31.0\n301847,911\n248155,130\n1446869\n1419003\n3\n0,364\n0,186\n6\n\n\n8/10/2023\n31:22.0\n301868,008\n248170,170\n1446827\n1418960\n3\n0,147\n0,072\n7\n\n\n8/10/2023\n30:20.0\n301875,048\n248297,576\n1452434\n1424571\n3\n0,235\n0,161\n8\n\n\n8/10/2023\n00:47.0\n301968,070\n248386,332\n1451916\n1424048\n4\n0,235\n0,09\n9\n\n\n8/11/2023\n58:29.0\n301263,276\n246688,966\n1308378\n1280506\n4\n0,656\n0,64\n17\n\n\n8/11/2023\n40:23.0\n301456,505\n246350,882\n1292738\n1264830\n2\n0,054\n0,055\n18\n\n\n8/11/2023\n04:19.0\n301430,773\n246394,964\n1296034\n1268131\n2\n0,077\n0,064\n19\n\n\n8/11/2023\n30:58.0\n301364,741\n246498,245\n1300102\n1272211\n4\n0,364\n0,259\n20\n\n\n8/11/2023\n34:20.0\n301586,893\n247430,776\n1319567\n1291696\n5\n0,604\n0,323\n27"

    "text": "ICP registration\nUnlike global alignment, fine registration methods require two point clouds that already have a rough correspondence. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is commonly used for local refinement and has two main variants:\nPoint-to-point ICP\nThe Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration method using the point-to-point variant was introduced by Besl and McKay (1992). This iterative algorithm consists of two stages in each iteration:\n\nFirst, for each point in the source point cloud, it searches for the closest point in the target point cloud.\nSecond, it attempts to find a transformation that minimizes the distance between the corresponding points.\n\nThese two processing stages are repeated until convergence (Salvi et al., 2007).\nPoint-to-plane ICP\nThe point-to-plane variant of the ICP algorithm takes into account that scanned objects are not individual points, but surfaces. Unlike point-to-point, which tries to minimize the distance between individual points, the point-to-plane method assumes that points in the source point cloud are generally on a surface of the target point cloud. This accounts for the fact that the source and target point clouds are not necessarily identical.\nThe general processing procedure of the point-to-plane method is similar to that of the point-to-point approach. However, instead of searching for the closest points between the source and target point clouds, the method calculates the intersection of the point normal in the source point cloud with the tangent plane at its corresponding point in the target point cloud. Then, the algorithm attempts to find a transformation that minimizes the distance between points and the tangent planes at its correspondence points (Low, 2004). This process is repeated until convergence.\nPulli (1999) emphasize the advantages of the point-to-plane method compared to the point-to-point method. Some of the arguments and findings are:\n\nThe point-to-plane method converges an order of magnitude faster than the point-to-point method.\nThe point-to-point method typically requires at least ten times more point matching and alignment iterations than the point-to-plane method.\nThe point-to-plane method is not significantly slowed down by false point pairs since each point can slide along the tangent plane of its corresponding point."
